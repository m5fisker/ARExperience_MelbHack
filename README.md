# ARExperience_MelbHack

## About the Project
An AR application to assist in educating students on labs from home.
## Inspiration
The COVID-19 outbreak is having a huge effect on everyone, with balancing personal, work and learning proving immensely difficult. This brought additional concerns and uncertainties once education systems implemented distance learning schemes for public health management. Universities stopped face-to-face education and have been advised to rapidly offer online learning tools. University staff and educators had to meet new online education challenges shifting toward video demonstrations without much interaction with students. Nevertheless, many students studying in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics are finding it particularly challenging to engage with the practical activities.

## What it does
Since the pandemic needs to be understood as an opportunity for adaptation and education improvements and isolation and disconnectedness may lead to a loss of educational engagement, our project ARxperiment develops an AR to create an online face-to-face classroom that is conducive to simulate practical work. This has not yet been done in the Australian context.

## How we built it
We first drafted the design with Figma, after deciding on the AR experiment we want to demonstrate, we built it using Swift, Maya, and echoAR.
